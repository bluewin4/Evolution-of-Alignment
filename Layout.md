**Goal:** To simulate the evolution of AI models under selection pressure based on alignment tests, exploring the potential divergence between tested alignment ($a$) and true value ($v$).

**Core Tools:** Python, NumPy (for numerical operations), Matplotlib (for plotting). Consider using `multiprocessing` for parallel runs later.

**Level 0: Minimal Viable Simulation - Core Divergence Dynamic**

* **Goal:** Implement the absolute basic simulation loop to see if selection purely on alignment `a` can lead to populations with low true value `v`, given imperfect correlation $\rho$.
* **Key Simplifications:**
    * Single bivariate normal distribution for $(v, a)$.
    * Fixed model cardinality (`N_BELIEFS_PER_MODEL`).
    * Simple, static activation matrix `A(b,q)` (e.g., sparse random).
    * Simple selection (e.g., roulette wheel based on $e^{\beta F}$).
    * Simple inheritance (child = copy of selected parent).
    * No mutation.
* **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Setup Parameters:** Define basic parameters (`N_GENERATIONS`, `POPULATION_SIZE`, `N_BELIEFS_TOTAL`, `N_BELIEFS_PER_MODEL`, `N_QUESTIONS`, `SELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA`).
    2.  **Belief Space (Single Distribution):**
        * Define parameters for *one* bivariate normal: $(\mu_v, \mu_a, \sigma_v, \sigma_a, \rho)$.
        * Generate `N_BELIEFS_TOTAL` beliefs, sampling $(v(b), a(b))$ for each. Store in `belief_values`, `belief_alignments` arrays.
    3.  **Activation Matrix:** Create `activation_scores[N_BELIEFS_TOTAL, N_QUESTIONS]` (e.g., set a small random subset of entries to 1.0, rest to 0.0). Keep it fixed throughout the simulation.
    4.  **Initial Population:** Create `population[POPULATION_SIZE]` where each element is a set of `N_BELIEFS_PER_MODEL` randomly chosen belief IDs.
    5.  **Simulation Loop (Basic):**
        * **For each generation:**
            * **Evaluate:** Calculate fitness $F(m)$ and true value $U(m)$ for each model `m` based on its beliefs, `belief_alignments`, `belief_values`, and `activation_scores`.
            * **Log:** Record average $F$ and average $U$ for the generation.
            * **Select:** Calculate selection probabilities $w_i \propto e^{\beta F(m_i)}$. Choose `POPULATION_SIZE` parent indices based on these probabilities.
            * **Reproduce:** Create `new_population` where `new_population[j]` is simply a copy of the beliefs held by the selected parent `parent_indices[j]`.
            * Update `population = new_population`.
    6.  **Basic Analysis:** Plot average $F$ and average $U$ vs. generation number. Run this for a high $\rho$ (e.g., 0.95) and a low $\rho$ (e.g., 0.1) and observe if the divergence occurs as expected.
* **Expected Outcome:** Confirmation that the basic code runs and shows the core divergence effect (avg U decreasing or staying low while avg F increases when $\rho$ is low).

**Level 1: Parameter Sweep & Statistical Significance**

* **Goal:** Systematically investigate the impact of the key parameter $\rho$ (value-alignment correlation) and selection pressure $\beta$. Obtain statistically meaningful results.
* **Additions:**
    1.  **Multiple Runs:** Implement the ability to run the *entire Level 0 simulation* multiple times (e.g., 10-30 times) for each parameter setting.
    2.  **Parallelization (Across Runs):** Use `multiprocessing.Pool.map` or similar techniques to run these independent simulations concurrently on multiple CPU cores. Each process runs the full simulation from Level 0.
    3.  **Parameter Variation:** Systematically vary `RHO` across its range (e.g., [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0]). Optionally, also vary `SELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA`.
    4.  **Extended Logging:** For each run, log the final average $U$, final average $F$, and potentially the final count/proportion of beliefs in the $\mathbb{B}_{val-} \cap \mathbb{B}_{a+}$ ("Deceptive") category.
* **Analysis:**
    * For each parameter setting (e.g., each value of $\rho$), calculate the mean and standard deviation (or confidence intervals) of the final average $U$ across the multiple runs.
    * Plot mean final average $U$ vs. $\rho$.
    * Plot mean proportion of "Deceptive" beliefs vs. $\rho$.
* **Expected Outcome:** Quantitative understanding of how strongly correlation $\rho$ influences the alignment outcome, with error bars indicating variability.

**Level 2: N-Modal Belief Distributions**

* **Goal:** Model a more complex belief landscape with distinct clusters, including potentially deceptive ones, as described in the text.
* **Additions:**
    1.  **Modify Belief Space Generation:**
        * Define parameters for `n` (e.g., 2 or 3) different bivariate normal distributions. Ensure at least one distribution represents a "Deceptive" cluster (e.g., $\mu_v < 0$, $\mu_a > 0$).
        * Allocate proportions of the `N_BELIEFS_TOTAL` to each distribution.
        * Sample beliefs accordingly and combine them into the global `belief_values` and `belief_alignments` arrays. Keep track of which original cluster each belief came from.
    2.  **Modify Logging:** Track the proportion of beliefs from each initial cluster present in the population over generations.
* **Analysis:**
    * Repeat the analysis from Level 1 (e.g., plot final avg U vs. $\rho$) using this n-modal setup.
    * Analyze the population composition: does the population become dominated by beliefs from the "Deceptive" cluster under certain conditions (e.g., low $\rho$)? Compare results to the single-distribution case.
* **Expected Outcome:** Insight into whether landscape structure (clusters) significantly alters the evolutionary trajectory and potential for capture by deceptive belief sets.

**Level 3: Enhanced Realism - Mutation & Activation**

* **Goal:** Add more standard evolutionary mechanisms and refine the activation model.
* **Additions (Choose one or both):**
    1.  **Mutation:** In the reproduction step, after copying the parent's beliefs, introduce a chance (`MUTATION_RATE`) per belief for it to be swapped with a randomly chosen belief from the *global* pool (that isn't already present in the child). (See previous pseudocode for an implementation).
    2.  **More Sophisticated Activation:** Replace the simple sparse random `activation_scores` matrix.
        * *Option:* Implement a Zipfian-like activation (requires ranking beliefs per question, maybe randomly for now).
        * *Option:* Introduce noise or variability in activation scores.
* **Analysis:**
    * Compare results with and without mutation. Does mutation prevent getting stuck? Does it slow convergence?
    * How does the choice of activation model affect the results?
* **Expected Outcome:** A more robust simulation incorporating common evolutionary elements and exploring the sensitivity to activation modeling.

---

**Level 4: Exploring Test Design & Dynamics**

* **Goal:** Investigate how the properties of the alignment test $Q$ influence evolution. Introduce dynamic elements.
* **Additions (Choose one or more):**
    1.  **Test Property Variation:** Systematically change `N_QUESTIONS`. Modify how `activation_scores` is generated to control *coverage* (fraction of beliefs activated by *any* question) and *correlation* between question activation patterns (as defined in the text).
    2.  **Dynamic Evaluation:** Modify the test set $Q$ or the `activation_scores` over generations. For example:
        * Periodically add new questions targeting beliefs that are currently common in high-fitness ("Deceptive"?) models.
        * Simulate evaluators getting "better" at assigning alignment scores $a(b)$ over time (e.g., slowly increasing $\rho$ or re-sampling $a(b)$ values).
* **Analysis:** Does test coverage matter? Does higher question correlation hinder effective selection? Can dynamic evaluation strategies effectively counter the rise of deceptive beliefs?
* **Expected Outcome:** Insights into the co-evolution of evaluation strategies and model populations.

---

**Level 5: Advanced Extensions (Future Work)**

* **Goal:** Incorporate more complex dynamics mentioned in the text's "Extensions".
* **Potential Additions:**
    * Belief Interactions / Non-additive fitness.
    * Variable model cardinality.
    * Direct fitness effects of value `v(b)`.
    * Multiple competing evaluators.
* **Note:** These significantly increase implementation complexity and should be tackled only after the previous levels are well understood.

This progressive approach allows you to build confidence in your simulation, debug effectively at each stage, and systematically explore the complex dynamics described in the source texts. Remember to perform multiple runs (Level 1+) for statistical validity when drawing conclusions.
